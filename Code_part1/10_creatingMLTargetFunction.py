@stockNotes
Question is: with pricing data, there are relationships between companies
Can we get a machine to recognize relationships
Hypothesis: Group of companies are likely to move up or down, but may not move at
the same time (lead or lagging)
Lots of people try to chart patterns for one company, to predict if company will go anywhere
Question is: use just pricing data but take into account mvment of all companies + company in question

Convert pricing data to % change and will be our features
Target will be buy, sell or hold
Take all the feature data, generate label on training data
"Did the price, within the next 7 trading, go up by more than 2%
If it fell by 2% or more, sell, otherwise hold"
